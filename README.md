# Adyen [online payment](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments) integration demos

## Run this integration in seconds using [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/)

* Open your [Adyen Test Account](https://ca-test.adyen.com/ca/ca/overview/default.shtml) and create a set of [API keys](https://docs.adyen.com/user-management/how-to-get-the-api-key).
* Go to [Gitpod account variables](https://gitpod.io/variables).
* Set the `ADYEN_HMAC_KEY`, `ADYEN_RELAYED_AUTH_HMAC_KEY`, and `ADYEN_BALANCE_PLATFORM` variables.
* Click the button below.

## Details
A simple relayed auth listener - intended to be launched via gitpod and hardcoded to approve all relayed auth transactions except when amount = 9.99. That magic value will result in relayedAuth declines.

## Requirements

- Python 3.5 or greater
- Python libraries:
  - flask
  - uuid
  - Adyen v8.0.0 or higher

## Gitpod Usage

RelayedAuth delivers asynchronous notifications during issuing auth events. It is important to test them during the setup of your integration. You can find more information about relayed auth [here](https://docs.adyen.com/issuing/authorisation/relayed-authorisation/).

This sample application provides a simple relayed auth endpoint exposed at `/api/webhooks/relayedAuth`. For it to work, you need to:

1. Be running this repo via Gitpod
2. Setup your relayed auth endpoint to point to your Gitpod instance via the Adyen BPCA. 

### Making your server reachable
Your endpoint that will consume the incoming relayed auth message must be publicly accessible. To easily enabled this, click the "Open in gitpod" button. 
When launching a gitpod instance, it will be hosted on a URL like:
```
https://tddouglas-relayedauthgi-1bemp1hw5t3.ws-us108.gitpod.io/
```
You will need to take that url and prepend the specific port forwarding info (`8080-`) and append the relayedAuth listener path. The final URL you enter into the Customer Area should look like the below:
```
https://8080-tddouglas-relayedauthgi-1bemp1hw5t3.ws-us108.gitpod.io/api/webhooks/relayedAuth
```
**Note:** when starting a new Gitpod workspace the host changes, make sure to **update the Webhook URL** in the Customer Area

### Set up relayed auth
* In BPCA go to Issuing -> Relayed Auth
* Enter the URL of your application/endpoint (see options [above](#making-your-server-reachable))
* Define username and password for Basic Authentication (Not implemented yet)
* Generate the HMAC Key
* Make sure to Save the config after modifying the URL

That's it! Every time you perform a new payment, your application will receive a notification from the Adyen platform.
